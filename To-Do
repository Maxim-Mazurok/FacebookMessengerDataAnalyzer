Add error handling for when there are no json files in the selected folder

Change conditionals that reference excluded word array to just compare words in lower case, so there is not duplicate words in the array (use ToLower)

Convert duplicated code in each function to classes (each function right now has a lot of duplicated code, mostly in the plot code).

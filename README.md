This Python script runs analysis on Facebook Messenger, based on JSON files provided by Facebook.

You must download your Facebook data in JSON format before running this script. To download your Facebook data:

1. Go to your **facebook.com**
2. Go to **Settings** \&gt; **Your Facebook Information**
3. Click **Download Your Information**
4. Under **Date Range** select **All of my data**
5. Under **Format** select **JSON**
6. Under **Media Quality** select **Low**
7. Select **Create File**
  1. Facebook will notify you via email when your data is ready for download. This usually takes about 24 hours.

The script begins by asking the user to select a folder with JSON data within to run queries on. The messenger files are in your **Facebook data folder** > **messages** > **inbox**.
